    <p class="line">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related
         to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences
          should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the 
          subdivisions of an essay begin and end,
         and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

    <h1 class="heading1">this is also heading</h1>
    <p id="line2">the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences 
        at the beginning of the paragraph that give background information or provide a transition
